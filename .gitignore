# Ignore the huge folder of downloaded dependencies
node_modules

# Ignore the file containing your secret database credentials
.env


### Step 4: Add and Commit Your Files

Now, you'll stage all your project files (except those you ignored) and save a snapshot of them in your local repository's history.

```bash
# Stage all files for the commit
git add .

# Save the files with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up backend server with login and query APIs"
